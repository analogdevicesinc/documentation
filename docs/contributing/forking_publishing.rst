Forking and publishing
======================

The steps below are a walk-through to contribute to
:git-documentation:`this </>` repository,
It ensures that GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages are enabled, so you can run
continuous integration and see the pages live at *<your_user>.github.io/documentation*,
and `git-lfs <https://git-lfs.com/>`__ artifacts are properly synced.

.. note::

   Using the Python virtual environment (venv) is recommended, but if you wish
   to not use it, skip steps in :green:`green`.

Preparing your origin
---------------------

There is three options to host your work, for users:

* :ref:`forking-publishing fork`: that want to use the GitHub flow (recommended).
* :ref:`forking-publishing copy`: that want to work privately first.
* :ref:`forking-publishing branch`: with write access to *analogdevicesinc* organization.

.. _forking-publishing fork:

Fork
~~~~

Ensure git-lfs is installed with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install git-lfs -y

Fork the *analogdevicesinc/documentation* repo on your account.

| **Enable the workflows** on the forked repo at *github.com/<your_user>/documentation/actions*
  by clicking the green button
| "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them".

Clone the repository:

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/documentation \
   $    --depth=10 -- documentation
   $cd documentation

.. _forking-publishing copy:

Copy
~~~~

Ensure git-lfs is installed with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install git-lfs -y

Clone mainland:

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/documentation \
   $    --depth=10 -- documentation
   $cd documentation

Setup both origins, for example, call *analogdevicesinc* ``public`` and your
copy ``private`` at the *.git/config*, similar to:

::

   [core]
   	repositoryformatversion = 0
   	filemode = true
   	bare = false
   	logallrefupdates = true
   [remote "public"]
   	url = https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/documentation.git
   	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/public/*
   [remote "private"]
   	url = https://github.com/<your_user>/documentation.git
   	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/private/*
   [branch "main"]
        # Set your private copy as upstream
   	remote = private
   	merge = refs/heads/main
   [lfs "https://github.com/<your_user>/documentation.git/info/lfs"]
   	access = basic
   [lfs "https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/documentation.git/info/lfs"]
   	access = basic


Push the working branch to your copy.

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $git push private main:main

Fetch from *analogdevicesinc* and push to your copy the large files binaries:

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $git lfs fetch --all public
   $git lfs push --all private

.. _forking-publishing branch:

Branch
~~~~~~

If you have write permission to the repository, you shall add your work to a
branch at mainland, then just:

Ensure git-lfs is installed with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install git-lfs -y


Clone the repository

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/documentation \
   $    --depth=10 \
   $    -- documentation
   $cd documentation

Create and checkout a branch

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $git checkout -b <your_branch>

Preparing your environment
--------------------------

Clone and build the doc for the first time (working directory: repo root):

Ensure pip is up-to-date:

.. code:: bash

   pip install pip --upgrade

:green:`Setup the virtual env at the repo root path:`

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $python -m venv ./venv

:green:`Activate the virtual env`:

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $source ./venv/scripts/activate

Install the requirements:

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $(cd docs ; pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade)

Build the doc (output at docs/_build/html):

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $(cd docs ; make html)

Adding content
--------------

Add a new topic and pages (working directory: docs).

On *index.rst*, add a new topic:

::

   .. toctree::
      :caption: My new topic
      :maxdepth: 2

       my_topic/index

Or add to an existing, for example, in *eval/index.rst*.

.. tip::

   Don't overthink the location at this point, it can be easily moved later.

Create a new folder and file matching the entry from last step:

.. shell::

   ~/documentation/docs
   $mkdir my_topic; touch my_topic/index.rst

Edit *my_topic/index.rst*, adding a title and some content.

Build the doc and see the changes.

Commit the changes.

For a extensive guide on adding content see :ref:`creating-new-pages`.

Pushing and triggering the CI
-----------------------------

The CI (.github/workflows/top-level.yml) builds the doc and pushes to the
``gihub-pages`` branch and is triggered on push to main and on pull request
(every time):

* On pull request, the build doc target is run, which builds the doc and stores it as an artifact.
* On push to main, the build doc and deploy targets are run, the latter commits the doc artifact to the gh-pages branch.

.. tip::

   You can see the runs at github.com/<your_user>/documentation/actions.

Enable GitHub Pages to have the public website
configure GitHub Pages at *github.com/<your_user>/documentation/settings/pages*:

* Set Source as "deploy from branch"
* Set the branch as "gh-pages"

Resuming work at a later time
-----------------------------

:green:`Reactivate the virtual environment with:`

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $source ./venv/scripts/activate

Ensure the tools are up to data from time to time with:

.. shell::

   ~/documentation
   $(cd docs ; pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade)

Edit, build, commit, push as usual.
