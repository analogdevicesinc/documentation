Why "ADALM2000"
===============

The name of the device is pretty much self-explanatory considering the fact
that the first created USB powered learning tool is :adi:`ADALM1000` (M1K).

The much more complex successor, ADALM2000 takes the capabilities of the
:adi:`ADALM1000`` (M1K) Active Learning Module to the next level, brings the
power of high performance lab equipment to the pocket of the user, enabling
electrical engineering students and hobbyists to explore signals and systems
into the tens of MHz without the cost and bulk associated with traditional lab
gear.
