Ecosystem Overview
===============================================================================

Welcome to the ADI System Level Documentation ecosystem overview. This section
provides a high-level introduction to how Analog Devices' prototyping software
and HDL components work together to help you bring your designs from concept to
reality.

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analog Devices provides a comprehensive ecosystem of hardware, HDL (Hardware
Description Language) reference designs, software drivers, libraries, and
applications to accelerate your development process. Whether you're building a
high-speed FPGA-based data acquisition system, a precision embedded measurement
device, or a prototyping platform on a Raspberry Pi, the ADI ecosystem provides
the building blocks you need.

The Integrated System Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the heart of the ADI approach is an **integrated system philosophy**: we surround
your processor, FPGA, or microcontroller with best-in-class ADI analog and mixed-signal
components, along with all the software and HDL support needed to make them work
seamlessly together.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, we leverage established ecosystems:

- **Linux Kernel** for OS-based systems
- **GitHub** for open-source collaboration
- **Python** and **MATLAB** for rapid prototyping
- **IIO (Industrial I/O)** framework for standardized device interfaces
- **Standard FPGA toolchains** (Vivado, Quartus) for HDL development

This approach means you can focus on your application logic and signal processing
while relying on proven, tested infrastructure for interfacing with ADI devices.

What the Ecosystem Provides
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ADI ecosystem spans seven layers, from hardware to high-level applications:

   :widths: 20 80

   * - Layer
     - Description
   * - **Hardware**
     - ADI devices (ADCs, DACs, transceivers, sensors, IMUs, PLLs, DDS, etc.)
   * - **Interface**
     - FPGA, processor, or microcontroller platforms (Zynq, ZynqMP, Versal,
       Raspberry Pi, STM32, MAX32, etc.)
   * - **HDL/Firmware**
     - FPGA reference designs with IP cores (JESD204, SPI Engine, DMA controllers)
       and bare-metal firmware for microcontrollers
   * - **Drivers**
     - Linux IIO kernel drivers, Zephyr drivers, devicetree support
   * - **Libraries**
     - Hardware abstraction libraries (libiio, libm2k)
   * - **Language Bindings**
     - Python (pyadi-iio), MATLAB toolboxes, C/C++ APIs
   * - **Applications**
     - GUI tools (Scopy, IIO Oscilloscope), Linux distributions (Kuiper Linux)

Each layer builds on the one below it, creating a complete path from silicon to
software application.

Who Should Read This
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This overview is designed for:

- **Engineers new to ADI's ecosystem** who want to understand how the pieces fit together
- **Experienced developers** looking for the right starting point for their project
- **System architects** evaluating ADI solutions for their designs
- **Students and researchers** learning about mixed-signal system development

What You'll Learn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This overview covers:

   architecture
   components
   workflows
   versioning-support

**Architecture** explains the full-stack architecture and design philosophy,
showing how data flows from hardware through HDL, drivers, libraries, and
applications. Includes detailed diagrams of ecosystem interdependencies,
demonstrating how HDL serves as a common foundation for both FPGA (Linux)
and microcontroller (no-OS) paths, with host tools working uniformly across
both through libiio.

**Components** provides detailed information about each major ecosystem component:
HDL, Linux kernel drivers, libiio, no-OS, pyadi-iio, and applications.

**Workflows** shows concrete examples of how components work together in
real-world scenarios: FPGA-based high-speed systems, microcontroller precision
measurement, and Raspberry Pi prototyping.

**Versioning & Support** explains how versioning works across components, which
versions work together, and where to get help.
