The platform consists of three main components:
- **[AD9081-FMCA-EBZ](hardware/mxfe/index)** - AD9081 MxFE Evaluation Board
- **[ADXUD1AEBZ](hardware/converter/index)** - X/C Band Up/Down Converter
- **[ADAR1000EVAL1Z](hardware/beamforming/index)** - X/Ku-Band Analog Beamforming Board (Stingray)

The system is designed to mate with a {xilinx}`ZCU102 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html>` Evaluation Board from Xilinx®, featuring the Zynq® UltraScale+™ ZU9EG FPGA, with provided reference software, HDL code, and MATLAB/Python system-level interfacing.

## Target Applications

The X-Band Development Platform enables quick time-to-market development programs for:

- **ADEF (Phased-Array, RADAR, EW, SATCOM)**
- **Hybrid Beamforming**
- **Electronic Test and Measurement**
