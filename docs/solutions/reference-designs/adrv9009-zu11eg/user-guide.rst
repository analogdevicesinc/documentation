Hardware Design Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   For Clock Distribution Synchronization, some passive components must be
   replaced on the :dokuwiki:`ADRV2CRR-FMC Carrier Board </resources/eval/user-guides/adrv9009-zu11eg/adrv2crr-fmc_carrier_board>`.

   **Rev C:**

      - Replace C18, C19, C236, C240 with 0 Ohm resistors
      - Replace C289, C290 with 0 Ohm resistors
      - Unload 0 Ohm resistors from location R77, R112 and insert to R110, R111

   **Rev C.1:**

      - Replace C289, C290 with 0 Ohm resistors
      - Unload 0 Ohm resistors from location R77, R112 and insert to R110, R111

Application Development
-----------------------

Multiple :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG`s can be synchronized together enabling a
complete solution for complex multi-stream applications ensuring end-to-end
deterministic latency. The :adi:`ADRV9009` Transceivers include integrated LO
and phase synchronization. Overall system frequency & phase synchronization is
maintained with a clock tree structure using ADI high performance low jitter
:adi:`HMC7044` devices, making it ideal for applications requiring RF phase
alignment with a large number of channels.

The :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG` has extensive I/O capability. Combined with the
:adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC` evaluation carrier board a variety of high speed I/O can be
evaluated, including USB3, USB2, PCIe 3.0 x8, QSFP+, SFP+, 1Gb Ethernet x2, and
CPRI capability. Please review the I/O functionality reference table provided
in the :dokuwiki:`ADRV2CRR-FMC <resources/eval/user-guides/adrv9009-zu11eg/adrv2crr-fmc_carrier_board>`
homepage for more details on the functionality provided.

An additional High Pin Count FMC Daughter Board (:adi:`AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ`) can be
plugged into the carrier board with a further two :adi:`ADRV9009` Transceivers
increasing to a total of Eight Tx and Rx channels. A design can easily be
evaluated and then integrated seamlessly into a custom carrier for further
prototyping, or a final product greatly accelerating time to market.

Platform development support includes examples of Linux Industrial I/O (IIO)
Applications, MATLAB®, Simulink®, GNU Radio, and streaming interfaces for
custom C, C++, python, and C# applications. HDL reference designs and drivers
will be provided to help users get up and running faster. Due to varying
implementation options for the various I/O interfaces different levels of
functionality will be provided for each one, further details will be available
in the applications section.

System Setup & Evaluation
-------------------------

The :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG` can be booted from the onboard SD card slot or the
SD card slot on the :adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC` carrier board. An SD card containing
a bootable image ships in the ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier kit.

Users should check that they have the appropriate Vivado license in place to be
able to use and build the reference HDL code provided for the Ultrascale+ MPSOC
in the system.
