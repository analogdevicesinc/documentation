AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ (Obsolete)
===============================================================================

Complete Motor Drive Evaluation System on an FMC Board.

.. warning::

   The :adi:`AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ` is a **legacy product** and is no longer
   actively supported. This documentation is provided for reference only.

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ` is a complete motor drive system on an FMC
board, designed to demonstrate efficient control of Brushed DC, BLDC, PMSM,
and Stepper motors. It consists of two boards - a controller board and a drive
board - and is optionally extended by a dynamometer module.

The system incorporates high-quality power sources; reliable power, control,
and feedback signal isolation; accurate measurement of motor current and
voltage signals; high-speed interfaces for control signals to allow fast
controller response; industrial Ethernet high-speed interfaces; and a flexible
FPGA/SoC control interface.

The platform is intended for prototyping and verifying hardware and control
algorithms before moving to production. Example reference designs for Xilinx
FPGAs/SoCs and MathWorks Simulink are provided with the hardware.

The system consists of:

- :adi:`AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ` - Controller board, compatible with all Xilinx
  FPGA platforms with FMC LPC or HPC connectors.
- :adi:`AD-DRVLV1-EBZ` - Low voltage drive board. Connects to the Controller
  board and drives Brushed DC / BLDC / PMSM / Stepper motors up to 48 V
  and 18 A.
- :adi:`AD-DYNO1-EBZ` - Dynamometer drive system. An electronically adjustable
  load with two BLDC motors in a dyno setup (optional).

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience
with things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as
it should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ez:`/`, but before that, please make sure you read our documentation
thoroughly.

Help and Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any questions regarding the ADI motor drive solutions or are
experiencing any problems while using the boards or following any of the user
guides, feel free to ask on our support community :ez:`/`.

For questions regarding the hardware or the HDL reference design, post in the
:ez:`FPGA Reference Designs <community/fpga>` sub-community. For questions
regarding the Linux drivers for any of the components on the motor control
boards, use the
:ez:`Linux Software Drivers <community/linux-software-drivers>`
sub-community.

When asking a question, please give a detailed description of your problem.
Always include which platform you are using with the AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ, the
steps you executed, the result you expected, and the result you actually got.

Before asking, also check if somebody else already asked the same question and
received an answer.
