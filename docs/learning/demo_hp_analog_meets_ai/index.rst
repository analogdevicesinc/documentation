DEMO High-Performance Analog Meets AI
===============================================================================

Extracting data from high-performance, high-data-rate analog signal chains for AI
model training and real-time inference presents significant challenges due to the
complexity of interfaces, processing, and integration requirements. Analog Devices
addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, open-source data extraction
and integration software stack, which ensures seamless connectivity between advanced

Demo description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo illustrates an AI-based multi-channel RF modulation scheme recognition
workflow for signal intelligence applications. Four AD-JUPITER-EBZ systems are used
to generate RF signals with different modulation schemes across a total of eight
channels. The signals are then digitized by two ADRV9009-ZU11EG SoMs, which stream
the raw IQ data to a host PC via 10Gb Ethernet links. The AI model, derived from
a MathWorks reference design, is deployed on the NVIDIA GPU hosted in the PC. The
NVIDIA Holoscan AI infrastructure manages the efficient transfer of data from the
network interfaces into GPU memory, where the AI model is executed. By combining
ADI’s high-performance data extraction infrastructure with MathWorks development
tools and NVIDIA deployment frameworks, the system enables efficient AI application
development and real-time execution for advanced signal intelligence tasks.
