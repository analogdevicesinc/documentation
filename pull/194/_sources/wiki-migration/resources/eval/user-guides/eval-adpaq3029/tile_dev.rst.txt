EVAL-ADPAQ3029 - Tile (GUI) development
=======================================

Application development for the Moduware platform consists of two primary parts: Firmware and Web based GUI application.

Firmware
--------

The firmware for the application development can be created in CrossCore Embedded Studio as explained in the previous section. CrossCore Embedded studio works with C programming language to access the hardware of the Dev Module. Using the Dev Module files, the Module Development Kit (MDK) is able to act as a median between the hardware and Web based software. Running a continuous loop, the MDK checks for any events or interrupts and uploads the corresponding data to the API via ``np_api_upload``. After being uploaded, the data response can be pulled from the tile app.

GUI Application
---------------

Moduware Modpack Tiles are created through the web based application consisting of:

-  ``driver.json``: register commands allowing the web based tile to communicate with the hardware registers (0x2700-0x27FF). Formatting of return data (0x2800+)
-  ``index.html``: User interface (ie: buttons, displays, etc.)
-  ``NexpaqHeader.js``: Event based functions allowing callbacks
-  ``Scripts.js``: Custom functions executed based on events ie: Button presses, returns from firmware package

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

Please find the example source code for Tile development in :doc:`resources </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/resources>` page.

-  The files that make up the tile can be opened and edited in any text editor.
-  Begin by initializing any functions declared in the MDK_REGISTER_CMD in the .json file.
-  In the same .json file create the format for the data to be read.
-  In the index.html file, the user interface can be created. This is where all buttons, displays, and text is programmed.
-  Open up the scripts.js file located in the js folder.

   -  Event listeners using the variables declared in index.html i.e: document.addEventListener(‘click’, function(e))
   -  Event listeners can call other functions within scripts.js
   -  Functions called by an event listener can remain local or make a callback to the firmware to obtain data or change the state of the hardware

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

Installing Moduware App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Install the basic version of the Moduware app that can be downloaded from the website https://Moduware.com/app/. The app is also available on play store.
-  Once the application is installed, launch the application. The following GUI is displayed when the application is opened.\ `image <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/tile2.png>`_
-  Click on ``FIND MODUWARE`` option to scan the devices available near you. Select the right device (the mini-dev board) and pair it.\ `image <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/tile3.png>`_
-  Once the connection is established between phone and the gateway, the screen appears as shown in the image. `image <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/tile4.png>`_
-  Since the Moduware phone backpack supports up to 6 slots to connect 6 different modules, the application shows 6 tiles. Since there is no firmware in the module and no tile has been stored in the mobile device memory, a dummy tile is displayed on the screen.

.. note::

   Make sure you turn on bluetooth before scanning for devices


Installing Tile GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once Tile development is complete and ready to test/run on smartphone:

-  Now, connect the smartphone to PC using USB in File transfer mode.
-  You should be able to see a new drive where files in Phone memory are visible.
-  Navigate to ``Moduware`` app directory and copy the whole tile source code directory to it.
-  If you could not find the ``Moduware`` directory, create a new one.
-  Make sure that the tile project files are within the folder named ``Moduware.tile.example-name``, where “name” is any project name.
-  Eject the smartphone drive and launch the moduware app again.
-  Connect the module/gateway as explained previously.
-  Now you should be able to see the new Tile GUI showing ``DevMod``.\ `image <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/tile5.png>`_

.. note::

   Many a times, there may be a dummy tile being dispalyed on the ``Moduware`` app as seen in the image. In this case, just disconnect the power cable from the modules and connect them back again.\ `image <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adpaq3029/tile6.png>`_
