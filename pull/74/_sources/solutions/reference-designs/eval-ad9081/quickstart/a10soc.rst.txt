Arria 10 SoC Quick start
===============================================================================

   :width: 800

This guide provides quick instructions on how to setup the
:adi:`EVAL-AD9081` on:

- :intel:`Arria 10 SoC <content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/arria/10.html>`
  (Rev. C or later) on FMCA

.. warning::

    :adi:`EVAL-AD9082` is not supported on
    :intel:`Arria 10 SoC <content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/arria/10.html>`!

Using Linux as software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Necessary files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

They can either be taken from the SD card -- already generated by us, or you
can build them manually.

In the following sections, we explain **how to take them from the SD card**.

The following files are needed for the system to boot:

- HDL boot image: ``fit_spl_fpga.itb``
- Linux Kernel image: ``zImage``
- Linux device tree: ``socfpga_arria10_socdk_sdmmc.dtb``
- U-Boot image: ``u-boot.img``
- ``extlinux.conf`` in the **extlinux** folder from SD Card
- Write ``u-boot-splx4.sfp`` from **socfpga_arria10_socdk_ad9081** folder on
  **third** SD Card partition:

    .. shell:: bash

       $lsblk
        NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT

        └─sda3        8:3    1    4M  0 part
       $dd if="./u-boot-splx4.sfp" of="/dev/sda3" bs=512

        1048576 bytes (1.0 MB, 1.0 MiB) copied, 0.25035 s, 4.2 MB/s

Instructions on how to manually build the boot files from source can be found
here:

- :dokuwiki:`Building the Intel SoC-FPGA kernel and devicetrees from source <resources/tools-software/linux-build/generic/socfpga>`
- :external+hdl:ref:`ad9081_fmca_ebz` build documentation. More HDL build details at
  :external+hdl:ref:`build_hdl`.

Required software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- microSD Card 16GB imaged with :external+adi-kuiper-gen:doc:`Kuiper <index>`
  (check out that guide on how to do it, then come back to this section)
- A UART terminal (Putty/Tera Term/Minicom, etc.) with baud rate 115200 (8N1)

Required hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :intel:`Arria 10 SoC <content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/arria/10.html>`
  (Rev. C or later) FPGA board and its power supply
- :adi:`EVAL-AD9081` FMC evaluation board
- microSD card with at least 16GB of memory
- Micro-USB cable (UART)
- LAN cable (Ethernet)
- 4x SMA cables (optional, but recommended)
- (Optional) USB keyboard & mouse and a HDMI compatible monitor

More details as to why you need these, can be found at
:ref:`ad9081 prerequisites`.

.. _ad9081 quickstart a10soc_changes:

A10SoC required hardware changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   The following rework is required on the A10SoC FPGA:

   To avoid using an external clock source and fully rely on the
   :adi:`HMC7044` clock chip, rotate the C6D/C4D caps in C5D/C3D position.
   (Please note: In the latest version of the board, this is now the default
   configuration, so this configuration step might not be needed anymore).

   If LEDS V1P0_LED and VINT_LED are not on please depopulate R22M and
   populate R2M.

In the default configuration of the
:intel:`Arria10 SoC Development Kit <content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/arria/10.html>`,
some of the FMC header pins are connected to a dedicated clock chip.
To be compatible with the :adi:`EVAL-AD9081`, these pins need to be connected
directly to the FPGA.

The connection of those pins can be changed by moving the position of
four zero Ohm resistors:

- R612 to R610
- R613 to R611
- R621 to R620
- R633 to R632

These resistors can be found on the backside of the A10SoC, underneath the
FMCA connector (J29). The following picture shows the required configuration
to be compatible with the :adi:`EVAL-AD9081`.

Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating the setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../../images/a10soc.jpg
   :width: 900

.. esd-warning::

In the following example, we will make a physical loopback between the ADC
and the DAC channels on the evaluation board, using SMA cables.

Follow the steps in this order, to avoid damaging the components:

#. Connect the SMA cables ADC0-DAC0, ADC1-DAC1, ADC2-DAC2, ADC3-DAC3
#. Connect the :adi:`EVAL-AD9081` / :adi:`EVAL-AD9082` FMC board to the
   FPGA carrier **HPC1** FMCA (J29) socket
#. Both the HPS (J26) and FPGA (J27) memory module must be installed on the A10SoC
#. Insert microSD card into the card socket on the FPGA
#. Configure the FPGA for SD card boot mode. That is the
   :intel:`default position <content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683735/current/boot-select.html>`
#. Plug-in an Ethernet cable from your router/switch to the Ethernet port on
   the FPGA board
#. Connect USB UART1 (J10) to your host PC
#. (Optional) Connect a monitor to the FPGA by HDMI, and a mouse and a keyboard
#. Connect the power supply for the FPGA
#. Turn on the power switch on the FPGA board
#. Observe Kernel and serial console output messages on your terminal (use
   the first ttyUSB or COM port registered)

.. image:: ../../images/a10soc_fmc_rework.jpg
   :width: 400

Boot messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is what is printed in the serial console, after you have
connected to the proper ttyUSB or COM port.

Configuring the FPGA will take a few seconds. Once the FPGA has been configured
the green D18 LED will turn on and the boot process will continue.

Useful commands for the serial terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The below commands are to be run in the serial terminal connected to the FPGA.

To find out the IP of the FPGA board, run the following command and take the
IP specified at "eth0 inet":

.. shell::

   $ifconfig

If the A10Soc is connected to a network with a DHCP server, the IP address
assigned to the board appears on the LCD.
To manually assign an IP address, run `ifconfig eth0 IP_ADDR`.

To see the IIO devices detected, run:

.. shell::

   $iio_info | grep iio:device
    iio:device0: 0-0014
    iio:device1: 0-0016

To see the EEPROM specifications, run:

.. shell::

   $fru-dump -b /sys/bus/i2c/devices/15-0050/eeprom

To use the :dokuwiki:`JESD204 status utility <resources/tools-software/linux-software/jesd_status>`,
run:

.. shell::

   $jesd_status

Additionally, if running ``stty rows 30`` before running ``jesd_status``, you
can expand the visible area of it and see more than 4 lanes.

To power off the system, run the following command, and wait for the final
message to be printed, then power off the FPGA board from the switch as well.

.. shell::

   $poweroff

To reboot the system, run:

.. shell::

   $reboot

   Even thought this is Linux, this is a persistent file systems. Care should
   be taken not to corrupt the file system -- please shut down things, don't
   just turn off the power switch. Depending on your monitor, the standard
   power off could be hiding. You can do this from the terminal as well with
   :code:`sudo shutdown -h now` or the above-mentioned command for powering off.
